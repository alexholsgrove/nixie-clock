## IV-18 driver board
42x20mm

## IV-18 breakout
This is a 41x27mm breakout board for the IV-18 nixie tube. It maps every pin on
the tube to a 2x10 2.54mm header.

[You can purchase the breakout on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/blinkenlight/iv-18-ice-tube-clock-breakout-board/).
The boards are a matt-ish black with lead-free HASL contacts.
